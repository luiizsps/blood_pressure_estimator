Seismocardiography (SCG) is the noninvasive measurement of local vibrations of the chest wall produced by the mechanical activity of the heart.
Electrocardiography (ECG) measures the heart eletric activity.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple optical technique used to detect volumetric changes in blood in peripheral circulation, by shining 
a light source onto the skin and measuring the light that is absorbed or reflected.

Extract signals:
- Pulse Transit Time (PTT) - Is not possible, needs two PPG sensors in different parts of the body.
- Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) - Can be extracted from the PPG and ECG signals.
- Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)
- Heart Rate (HR)
